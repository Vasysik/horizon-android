# Contributing to Starling

Thanks for helping. Starling is the Android port of [Horizon](https://github.com/ludovic111/horizon), Minecraft: Java Edition 26.3 rewritten in Rust. This page is the short version of how we work.

## Where a change goes

- **The game itself** (gameplay, world generation, rendering shared with the desktop, menus) belongs upstream, in Horizon, where it is checked against vanilla. Follow [Horizon's contributing guide](https://github.com/ludovic111/horizon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md): vanilla is the specification, and gameplay changes come with a parity harness.
- **The Android app** belongs here: the packaging (`packaging/android/`), the app's entry (`crates/horizon-client/src/android_lib.rs`), touch controls (`touch.rs`, `game/touch.rs`), the Starling folder and imports (`import.rs`, `game/imports.rs`, `game/files_offer.rs`) and anything that only matters on a phone.

## Build it

You need Rust (stable) with the `aarch64-linux-android` target, [cargo-ndk](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk), the Android SDK (build-tools 35.0.0, platform 36, NDK r28c), a JDK and Python 3.10+.

```sh
python packaging/android/build_apk.py            # build the library, then the APK
python packaging/android/build_apk.py --install  # and install it over adb
```

The APK carries no game files. On its first start the app signs in, downloads them from Mojang for an account that owns the game and prepares them on the phone; to skip that while testing, prepare the resources from your own copy of Minecraft 26.3 as described in [Build from source](README.md#build-from-source), zip them as a `.starling` file and open it with the app. The setup's hand-drawn skin comes from `python packaging/lowbudget/make.py` (Pillow): run it after changing `hand.py`, `make.py` or `strings.json`, and commit `pack/` with them.

## Test on a phone

Say what you checked on a real device, and on which one. A `horizon-args.txt` in the app's own files adds command-line arguments and environment variables at launch (one per line, `NAME=value` for the environment); with `--control-socket` and `HORIZON_CONTROL_PORT`, `horizon-ctl` drives the game over `adb forward`. Empty the file afterwards so the app starts normally.

## Only original code, or code whose license allows it

Starling is MIT, as Horizon is. Its code is written from Minecraft 26.3 itself and from public documentation. Another project's source may also be read and used, **only when that project's license allows it**:

- **Allowed:** MIT, MIT-0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, 0BSD, ISC, zlib, Apache-2.0, Unlicense, and the CC0-1.0 public-domain dedication. That code may be read, copied or adapted.
- **Everything else is off limits, even to read:** GPL, LGPL (Iris), AGPL, MPL, EPL, Polyform (Sodium), the Creative Commons licenses (CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC and the others; CC0 is a public-domain dedication, not one of them), custom or "source available" licenses, all rights reserved (OptiFine), and any project with no license or an unclear one. Don't read, copy, translate or paraphrase their source, and don't send code an AI tool wrote from it. Being able to download a mod or a pack does not give you the right to read its files.
- **Check the license yourself.** Read the LICENSE file at the commit you use and the header of each file you take: some repositories mix licenses, and a file under another license is off limits. A license that changed: the one at your commit counts. In doubt, don't: ask in an issue first.
- **Say it in the pull request:** the project, a link to the commit, its license, and what you read or copied.
- **Copied or adapted code** keeps its copyright line and license notice at the top of the file, and gets an entry in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). Apache-2.0 code also keeps its NOTICE text and says what was changed.

User documentation and file formats are fine to read, and packs and mods are fine to run and observe, whatever their license.

## Before a pull request

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
python3 tools/pr_ready.py
```

<<<<<<< C:\Users\Joaol\AppData\Local\Temp\tmphbb6d9jz\o
It runs rustfmt, clippy with warnings denied, the tests of the crates you touched, the Python tests and the public-tree check. Keep pull requests small, and write commit messages in English.

For the game workspace, Clippy checks all targets of the touched crates and their transitive workspace dependents, including examples. The dependency scope includes optional, platform, build and development dependencies. Tests run library, binary, integration and doc tests without building unrelated example executables. Shared Cargo configuration and toolchain changes select the whole workspace; CI also keeps its workspace-wide checks.

Never commit game files, decompiled source or prepared resources (`.local/`): `tools/check_public_tree.py` rejects them (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks` runs it before every commit). The pre-push hook checks the full history reachable from the branches and tags being pushed; `python3 tools/check_public_tree.py --history` audits the history of all local refs.

It looks at what your branch changes and runs what matters: rustfmt, clippy with warnings denied, the tests of the
crates you touched (and the launcher's), generated files, `Cargo.lock`, the Python tests, and the vanilla harnesses
your change can affect. Without the vanilla data on your machine it lists those harnesses instead; CI runs them.
`--quick` skips the harnesses. It exits non-zero when something fails.

## Claim before you start

Work is tracked in GitHub issues, and an issue that is assigned is taken (so is one with the `in progress` label:
claimed on Discord with Kira's `/claim`): pick another, or ask its holder in the thread. Before you start, comment
**`/claim`** on the issue; you are assigned at once, no role needed. No issue for your work yet? Open one (a line is
enough), then claim it. `/unclaim` gives it back.

A claim with no open pull request linking the issue (`Fixes #123` in the description, or a draft) is released after
5 days, with a comment: open a draft early. You can hold 8 open issues at a time, not counting the ones your
pull requests already fix. Agents claim the same way.

When your pull request changes the same functions as another open one, or closes the same issue, a bot comment names
it (edited on every push, never repeated): talk to its author in the thread before you both finish the same work.

## Pull requests

- **Small.** One change per pull request, under about 500 lines of code where you can; split bigger work into
  pieces that each make sense alone. Small pull requests get reviewed and merged the same day.
- **Fill in the template**: what and why, the vanilla reference, the pr_ready block, screenshots for anything you
  can see.
- **Tick "Allow edits by maintainers".** When something small is left (a lint, a rebase, a nit) we push the fixup
  ourselves instead of sending it back to you; only design questions come back.
- **Once we've pushed to your branch, merge main into it; don't rebase or force-push.** A rebase or force-push
  replaces our commits with yours and erases the fixes we added (it happened on #5188 and #5203). Tell your agent
  too: `git merge origin/main`, never `git rebase` or `git push --force` on a branch a maintainer has touched. If
  our fixes get erased anyway, we finish the work in our own pull request that keeps your commits and credits you.
- **Tick its kind** in the template: `parity` (Horizon now does what vanilla does), `bug` (a crash or breakage),
  `perf`, `feature` (new for players), `extra` (Horizon-only, off by default), `tooling` or `docs`. A workflow sets
  that label, and area labels (`launcher`, `mobs`, `worldgen`, `rendering`...) from the paths you change.
  `label:parity` is the list of real progress toward vanilla.
- **Release labels** (we set them if you can't): `feature` also puts it under "New" in the release notes,
  `skip-release` when players see no change (tooling, docs, tests), nothing for a fix.
  `release-now` is for crash fixes that shouldn't wait. pr_ready suggests one.

Who reviews and merges: the Horizon Team, on CI for ordinary pull requests; risky ones (saves, network, world
generation, the launcher's updates) wait for a local proof first ([merging](docs/release-flow.md#merging)).

Every merge to main is released automatically ([release flow](docs/release-flow.md)), so main always stays playable.
How agents, checks, releases and signed updates keep this safe: [security](docs/security.md).

## Parity checks on forks

The `verify` check (formatting, lints, tests) runs on every pull request. The `parity` check runs the affected
harnesses on a maintainer's machine, which holds the game files, so it never runs a fork's code on its own: a
maintainer reads your change, then adds the `run-parity` label, which runs it once on your current commit. After
new pushes, we add it again.
